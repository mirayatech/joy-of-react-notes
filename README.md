# Joy of React Notes ðŸ“’

These are just notes I've taken from the [Joy of React](https://www.joyofreact.com/) course by Josh Comeau. 

I'm sharing my notes here for anyone who might find them useful.

Keep in mind that I didn't capture everything from the course, so don't expect these notes to be comprehensive.

Feel free to explore these notes, and if you're also diving into the course, I hope they prove helpful on your React journey too!
