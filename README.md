# 📒 Joy of React Notes

These are just notes I've taken from the [Joy of React](https://www.joyofreact.com/) course by Josh Comeau. I'm sharing my notes here for anyone who might find them useful. 

Keep in mind that I **didn't capture everything** from the course, so don't expect these notes to be comprehensive. 

Feel free to explore these notes, and if you're also diving into the course, I hope they prove helpful on your React journey too!
