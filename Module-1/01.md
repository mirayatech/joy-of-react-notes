# 📚 React Basics

This is a quick guide to the basic ideas of React.

## 📦 What You Need

To use React, you need to import two things:

- `react`: The core of React.
- `createRoot` from `react-dom/client`: Helps with rendering.
- React can work on different machines, like:

- 🌐 The web
- 📱 Mobile devices
- 🖥️ 3D graphics

All use the same core React, but with platform-specific renderers.

## 🌎 How the Web Page Works

The DOM (Document Object Model) represents a web page's structure. Think of it as the live version of HTML. React uses JavaScript to work with the DOM, creating, updating, and deleting elements.

## 📝 Making a React Thing

Use `React.createElement()` to create a React element. Provide type, properties, and content as arguments. Result: a JavaScript object describing your element.

```javascript
const element = React.createElement("p", { id: "hello" }, "Hello, world!");
```

## 💻 Showing Your Thing

Render your app by locating the container with document.querySelector('#root'). Use createRoot() to designate it as the root and root.render(element) to display your React element.

This makes your idea turn into a real thing on the web page.

## ⚠️ Recent Changes

React 18 made some updates. Before, we used `ReactDOM.render()`, but now we have `createRoot` and `root.render()`. This makes things faster and lets us do more things at once.
