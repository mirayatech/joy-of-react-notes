# 🍌 Components

Components are the building blocks of React applications. A component is a function that returns JSX. Instead of seperating out application in to HTML, CSS, and JS files, we can create components that contain all three.

## Mechanics of reuse

Components are reusable. We can use the same component multiple times in the same application.

We can also use the same component in multiple applications.

## 👶🏽 Children Props

Components can be nested. The nested component is called the child component.

The component that contains the child component is called the parent component.

The child component can be accessed in the parent component using the `children` prop.

```jsx
function ParentComponent({ children }) {
  return <div>{children}</div>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <ParentComponent>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
    </ParentComponent>
  );
}
```

## 🚪 Fragments

We always need to return a single element from a component. If we want to return multiple elements, we can wrap them in a fragment.

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <p>How are you?</p>
    </>
  );
}
```

## 🔑 Keys

Keys are important when rendering lists of components. They help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.

The problem is if we don't provide a key, React will use the index of the item in the array as the key. This can cause problems if the order of the items changes.

```jsx
function App() {
  const items = ["🍌", "🍎", "🍇"];

  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map((item) => (
        <li key={item}>{item}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

## 🖌️ CSS Modules

Theyre a way to scope CSS to a component. This means we can use the same class names in different components without worrying about them conflicting.

```jsx
import styles from "./App.module.css";

function App() {
  return <div className={styles.container}>Hello World</div>;
}
```
